Python version : 3.9.21

### 1. **Library Installation and Dataset Loading**
- Installs required libraries (`torch`, `qiskit`).
- Loads the **Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer** dataset using `ucimlrepo`.
- Extracts features (`X`) and target labels (`y`).

---

### 2. **Dataset Exploration**
- Displays dataset metadata and variable information using pandas and IPython display.
- Shows a summary of the dataset: number of samples, features, and target classes.

---

### 3. **Class Distribution Visualization**
- Calculates and prints the count and proportion of each class (Malignant/Benign).
- Visualizes class distribution with a **custom-colored bar plot**.
- Prints a ratio to assess class balance and gives an interpretation.

---

### 4. **Data Preparation**
- Reads the raw CSV data, renames columns, and encodes the target (`diagnosis`) as 0/1.
- Normalizes features (z-score).
- Converts data to PyTorch tensors.
- Splits data into **train** and **test** sets (80/20 split).

---

### 5. **Quantum Circuit Definition**
- Defines a **Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA)** circuit using Qiskit.
- The circuit encodes classical data into quantum states and applies parameterized gates.

---

### 6. **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Model**
- A custom PyTorch layer for the quantum circuit (with autograd support) is implemented.
- Builds a **hybrid model**: a classical linear layer, a quantum layer, and a classical output layer.
- Trains the hybrid model using PyTorchâ€™s optimizer and loss function.
- Prints training loss and accuracy per epoch.

---

### 7. **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluates the trained hybrid model on the test set.
- Computes and prints **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**, and the confusion matrix.
- Prints false positives and false negatives.

---

### 8. **Classical ML Model Training**
- Trains four classical models: **Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Gradient Boosting** on the same data.
- Evaluates each model using the same metrics as above.
- Prints results for each model.

---

### 9. **Fairness & Bias Detection**
- Checks for sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, age, race).
- Since the real dataset lacks these, a **synthetic gender attribute** is added for demonstration.
- Calculates group-wise metrics and the **Disparate Impact Ratio (DIR)** for the synthetic attribute.
- Visualizes group fairness with a bar plot.

---

### 10. **Performance Visualization**
- Collects all metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for each model.
- Plots a **grouped bar chart** where each (model, metric) combination has a unique color.
- Custom legend explains the color coding.

---

### 11. **Summary**
- The notebook provides a full pipeline: data exploration, quantum and classical modeling, fairness demo, and comprehensive performance comparison.
